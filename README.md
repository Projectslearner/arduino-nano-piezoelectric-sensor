# Piezoelectric Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Piezoelectric Sensor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to interface with a piezoelectric sensor. A piezoelectric sensor generates an electrical charge in response to mechanical pressure or vibration. In this project, the sensor converts physical force, such as tapping or knocking, into an electrical signal, which is then read by the Arduino Nano.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Piezoelectric Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Piezoelectric Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the piezoelectric sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper power and ground connections for the piezoelectric sensor.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the piezoelectric sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Power Supply:**
   - Ensure the power supply connected to the piezoelectric sensor is appropriate for its voltage requirements.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display the sensor value read from the piezoelectric sensor.
   - Tap or knock on the sensor, and if the force exceeds the threshold value, the serial monitor will display "Tap detected!"

#### Applications

- **Vibration Detection:** Detect vibrations or impacts in various applications.
- **Force Sensing:** Measure force or pressure exerted on a surface.
- **Security Systems:** Use as part of a security system to detect physical intrusions or tampering.

#### Notes

- Adjust the threshold value in the code to customize the sensitivity of the tap detection.
- Ensure the sensor is securely mounted to the surface to accurately detect taps or knocks.
- Experiment with different materials and configurations to optimize the sensor's performance for specific applications.
